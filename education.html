    <h1>General Education Reflection</h1>
    <h3> List of General Educations</h3>
    <ul style="display:grid;">
      <li> Introduction to U.S. Latino/a Studies (LAS 211) </li>
      <li> Theatre and Society (THTRE 110) </li>
      <li> Principles of Microeconomics (ECON 101) </li>
      <li> Global Sustanability (M E 220) </li>
      <li> Introduction to American Government (POL S 215) </li>
    </ul>

    <p> My ideal short term goal is to graduate with honor at Iowa State University, my long term would be working for a company where I can develop all my skills that I've learn during my software engineering career. My ideal career environment in engineering would be a place where I can meet new people every day.  </p>

    <p> From my general elective I have learn many things. From LAS 211 I learned that not everyone is equal and each person has their own perspective of life, this has helped me in my software development career as I always try to focus on multiple users. From THTRE 110 I got that there is more in life than just math, people have different ways of solving problems and presenting them. This has helped me improve my creativity when solving any problems, thinking that there is always more than one way to getting to the final result. </p>

    <p> Taking ECON 101 showed me how to manage time better, as time is the most valuable resource in all sort of engineering problem solving. It has helped me looked things beyond engineering and showed me a better way to solve and innovate. </p>
